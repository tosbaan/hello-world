# hello-world
It is my first trial of Github, so I decided just follow the steps in help part.
I decided to leaarn Python from Udemy.com. In this class the instructor shared course notebooks on GitHub and a link to learn GitHub for those interested. As I have a full-time job as an auditor, most of the time I study at home. Today I had several hours before a meeting, so I decided to study a bit. I decided to dedicate those hours to GitHub. My friend who is a programmer always mention about the platform so it interested me, as well. I wish me a good luck on my way to programming :)
